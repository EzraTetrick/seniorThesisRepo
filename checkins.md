## Week 1 Summary (09/21/25)

### This week I worked on:

Researching which Python web framework to use. I have decided on using FastAPI for the front end component of my project. I also decided on using SQLite for the database but I plan on using SQALchemy to allow me to seemlessy switch to a more performant database if it becomes necessary in the future. FsatAPI has a builtin task scheduler that I wil use for the monitoring checks. If that turns out to not scale well enough then I will swap it out for something like Celery + Redis.

### This week I learned:

I learned about the different web frameworks available in python such as FastAPI, Flask, Django, but I ultimately decided to go with FastAPI because I would like to learn how to use it and it seems to scale well. I also learned about some other db options outside of SQlite which I have used before.

### My successes this week were:

Deciding which python libraries I am going to use.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Narrowing down my options and trying to keep my requirements simple.
